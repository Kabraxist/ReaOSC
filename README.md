# ReaOSC - Open Stage Control templates for Reaper

A basic [Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/) mixer template for [REAPER](https://reaper.fm). 
All widgets are relative to the screen size, so the template should work on any screen larger than iPad 4 (2013) (landscape).

Requires Open Stage Control version +1.17

Thanks very much to [TrashJazzAssasin for the previous template](https://github.com/ThrashJazzAssassin/REAPER-OSC-panels), which I studied to get handles of Open Stage Control.
